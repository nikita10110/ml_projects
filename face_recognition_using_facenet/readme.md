### Face_recognition using Facenet
In this walk through I have worked on Face recognition on celeb dataset using Facenet model. The dataset is divided into train and validation. Train has 290 images and validation has 90 images. To perform face recognition on the images. I need  facial images. For this I have applied face detection using the Haar Cascade model.

To perform face recognition using facenet. I have used a pretrained Inception resent network which is pretrained on vggface2. I have performed some finetuning on the network. I have removed all the last five layers and further I  added adaptive avg pool , linear layer, softmax in sequential manner so that it fits my dataset. I have also performed some transforms on the dataset before giving them as input to the model to train, transforms such as resize(), normalize() etc. Furthermore, I have trained the model with optimizer as stochastic gradient descent, criterion as cross entropy(). I have also performed the model inference on unseen person images and the model is able to predict the imageâ€™s  label correctly.  Also I did hyper tuning of parameters. I used learning_rate as 1e-3, momentum as 0.99. In this model I am able to get an accuracy of 90.26% on train and 92.067% on validation.

In this repository, files such as ***facenet_using_pytorch.ipynb*** contains the code where i have built the model and model inference is performed.
